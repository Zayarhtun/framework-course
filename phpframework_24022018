design pattern 
---------------
interface --> implement(only declare)
abstract --> extends(with implementation)

inject object in constructor is called dependencies injection.

object that can build object is called factory pattern.

static method cannot use $this

facede pattern is like wrapper class that summerize all methods.

methods that can run not only object but also objects collection methods is composite pattern.
